# Personal website
In 2018 after 10 years in graphic design I decided to give a shot to coding...

6 years later I mainly focus on building seamless user interfaces. You'll see me at my best when I am at the intersection between design and engineering. That's the sweet spot where I can leverage my skills and deliver the best UX.

When I am not in a front of a screen you can find me cooking or digging new music.
