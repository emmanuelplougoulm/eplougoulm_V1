        <p class="mb-4">
            Back in 2018 after a graphic designer career I decided to give a
            shot to coding and fell into a rabbit hole. My main focus is
            building efficient and satisfying user interfaces for humans. I am
            at my best when I find myself at the intersection between design and
            engineering, that's my sweet spot where I can leverage my skills and
            help delivering the best possible UX.<br /><br />When I am not in a
            front of a screen you can find me cooking or digging for "niche"
            music.
