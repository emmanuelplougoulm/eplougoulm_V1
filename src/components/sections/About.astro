        <p class="mb-4">
            Back in 2018 after a graphic designer career I decided to give a try
            to coding and fell into a rabbit hole. My added value? My skills as
            a former graphic designer combined with my technical expertise make
            me a complete frontend developer. I can identify potential UX/UI and
            technical improvements and implement them in your project. My main
            focus is building efficient and satisfying user interfaces for
            humans. I enjoy collaborating with designers and engineers to
            delivers the best UX/UI possible. When I am not in a front of a
            screen you can find me cooking, digging for "niche" music and
            reading.
